## Custom Widget - StopWatch
---

I have added a stopwatch as the custom widget as I think it matches with the rest of the widgets. It is very handy to have a stopwatch just as it is handy to have a timer. I have added the widget with a stopwatch display showing the time passed and four buttons - Start, Stop, Reset, Lap for the main functionailities of the stopwatch.

When the user uses the lap button, a list showing the laps and the lap time will appear at the bottom of the widget, this container updates with the number of laps added and shows a list of all the lap times. Start, Stop and Reset buttons execute their conventional behaviors of starting the stop watch, pausing it and resetting the time respectively.

To match with the theme of the web app, I decided to not use borders with the buttons. The design thus looks clean and in sync with the rest of the widgets. The stopwatch display is also made bold to stand out from the buttons.
